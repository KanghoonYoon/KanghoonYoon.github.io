     I am a Senior AI Engineer at the Huawei Research Center in Singapore, where I joined the Audio & Video Algorithm Team in December 2025. 
     
     I earned my Ph.D. from KAIST in June 2025 under the guidance of <a href="https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor">Associate Professor, Chanyoung Park</a>, at the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (<a href="https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr">DSAIL</a>).

     My research portfolio spans Multimodal Foundation Models and Scene Understanding, with a strong focus on optimizing AI inference efficiency and advancing Graph Representation Learning. I am also deeply invested in enhancing the security of deep learning through research on adversarial attacks and robustness. 
     
     <b> I am always open to insightful discussions and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email at ykhoon0827@gmail.com or through LinkedIn. </b>

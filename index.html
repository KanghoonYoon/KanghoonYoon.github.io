<p>    Hi, I am Kanghoon Yoon, and I am Ph.D student in KAIST, department of industrial engineering & system.
       Now, I belong to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab <a href="https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr">(DSAIL)</a> directed by <a href="https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor">Prof. Chanyoung Park</a>.
       I am currently interested in <u>adversarial attacks & robustness on deep learning</u>, <u>graph representation learning</u>, <u>scene representation learning</u>, and <u>causal inference on deep learning</u>.

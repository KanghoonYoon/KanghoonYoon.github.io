Hi, I am Kanghoon Yoon, and I am Ph.D student in KAIST, department of industrial engineering & system.
Now, I belong to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL) directed by Prof. Chanyoung Park.
My interests are adversarial robustness on deep learning, graph representation learning, and scene representation learning.

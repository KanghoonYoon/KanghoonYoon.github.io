<p>    Hi, I am Kanghoon Yoon, and I am Ph.D student in KAIST, department of industrial engineering & system.
       Now, I belong to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab <a href="https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr">(DSAIL)</a> directed by <a href="https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor">Prof. Chanyoung Park</a>.
       I am currently interested in adversarial attacks & robustness on deep learning, graph representation learning, scene representation learning, and causal inference on deep learning.
       I am open to other research topics such as recommendation system, and bias alleviation problems too. Please contact me through email: ykhoon08@kaist.ac.kr </p>
